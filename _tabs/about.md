# 👋 Hi

I'm Wesley, aka Wez (GamerTag), and I recently graduated with an associate degree in network and system administration (and no, I am not that young lol). A couple of years ago I decided to finally get a degree, which I didn't really want as a young growing kid (rolls eyes, don't tell me). Nevertheless, better late than never, right?

It was quite the road, I must admit. In the same timespan I became a father of 2 beautiful girls and changed jobs twice so I'd be able to support my family and study at the same time - coming from working full time, 4 shifts.

But 5-6 years later I have my degree, and have 2-3 years of experience in the IT industry as a service desk engineer. Now I'm evolving into a Junior System Engineer.

I developed a passion for infrastructure automation (yeah, we had to set up servers quite a lot for our classes, which became rather boring) so I decided to self-study while attending classes. I learned tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Packer, and now I'm also studying Kubernetes, ArgoCD, etc. Who ever knew studying would become a hobby? *laughs*

## What I'm Working On

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- Configuration Management with Ansible
- Container Orchestration with Kubernetes
- GitOps with ArgoCD

Feel free to connect with me!
